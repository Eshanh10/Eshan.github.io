SHOULD I WEAR A
MASK TO PROTECT
MYSELF?
• People with no respiratory symptoms, such as cough, do not
need to wear a medical mask. WHO recommends the use of
masks for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and for
those caring for individuals who have symptoms, such as cough
and fever. The use of masks is crucial for health workers and
people who are taking care of someone (at home or in a health
care facility).
• WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid
unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of
masks (see Advice on the use of masks). Use a mask only if you
have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have
suspected COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms, or are caring
for someone with suspected COVID-19 infection. A suspected
COVID-19 infection is linked to travel in areas where cases have
been reported, or close contact with someone who has
travelled in these areas and has become ill.
• The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against
COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough
with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at
least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or
sneezing</p>
